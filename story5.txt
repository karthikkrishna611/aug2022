git clone url ("we use clone when we have to download repository for the first time")
git status ("we use git status to get current working branch name, also to check if we have any file changes we did not commit")
git checkout branchname ("we will use this to change the current branch")
Remote would the place where this code is saved at server, 
apart from remote we have a local file system,
local repository 
for untracked files the command we use is git add . for all the files 
for individual files git add filename
pull operation is to get the updated changes to local repo and local file system

#Staging
if you made changes in local file system if you have to get this changes to remote repository there are multiple steps.
1. staging
in staging process we have to select these files.
we will select the modified files using git add . or git add file name
2.second step is commiting the files. git commit -m="message"
commit will move the chnages form local file system to local repo.
3.Third step is Push the command will take the changes from local repo to remote repo.
4. Git pull 
5. In case of merge we are combining changes from two branches. mostly we will combine our feature story branch to the development branch. git merge origin/dev origin/ourbranchname.
6.To switch the branch we use the command git checkout.
7.
